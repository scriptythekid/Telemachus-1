* purpose: trying to make telemachus support MASCamera from [1]
* just editing "rpm-camera-support.cfg" and adding the partmodule "RasterPropMonitorCamera" to the stock-docking-port parts makes camera images available in telemachus, BUT rendered cameras seem off (rotated wrongly etc.)
* if i replace all occurences of "JSIExternalCameraSelector" with "MASCamera" in RasterPropMonitorCamera.cs there are no more cameras found by telemachus and therefore no more images rendered/returned
* todos
	* Check what's different at runtime if rpmPartModule == JSIExternalCameraSelector vs MASCamera  (null vs MASCamera)
	* Look into what changed from JSIExternalCameraSelector to MASCamera
		* adapt telemachus camera code accordingly
	* How can I more interactively debug this?

* MAS docu:
	* https://github.com/MOARdV/AvionicsSystems/wiki/Installation "Cameras in MAS behave a little differently than they did in RPM. Most importantly, you should name each camera or docking port camera. To do this: in the editor, right-click the part. There is a button to change its name. Click that, and type in a name. Each name should be unique, and you should probably give it a useful name, since that name can be displayed on MFDs."
