
#### notes

* purpose: trying to make telemachus support MASCamera from [1]
* just editing "rpm-camera-support.cfg" and adding the partmodule "RasterPropMonitorCamera" to the stock-docking-port parts makes camera images available in telemachus, BUT rendered cameras seem off (rotated wrongly etc.)
* if i replace all occurences of "JSIExternalCameraSelector" with "MASCamera" in RasterPropMonitorCamera.cs there are no more cameras found by telemachus and therefore no more images rendered/returned
* todos
	* Check what's different at runtime if rpmPartModule == JSIExternalCameraSelector vs MASCamera  (null vs MASCamera)
	* Look into what changed from JSIExternalCameraSelector to MASCamera
		* adapt telemachus camera code accordingly
	* How can I more interactively debug this?
